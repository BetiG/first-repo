          The polar bear yearlings venture out for the first time, the Arctic
          foxes and the Svalbard reindeers still wear their winter fur and seals
          and walruses can often be seen resting on the fjord ice. The little
          auks and the Brünnich’s guillemots have returned to their summer nests
          and the bird cliffs are teeming with life.
